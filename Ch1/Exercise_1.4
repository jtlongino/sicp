Exercise 1.4: Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

> If b is positive, return (+ a b). If b is negative or zero, return (- a b), or (+ a (-b)).
